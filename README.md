## About CoverUp
CoverUp adds to your module's test suite so that more of its code gets tested
(i.e., increases its [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage)).
It can also create a suite from scratch if you don't yet have one.
The new tests are based on your code, making them useful for [regression testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing).

CoverUp is designed to work closely with the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) test framework.
To generate tests, it first measures your suite's coverage using [SlipCover](https://github.com/plasma-umass/slipcover)
and selects portions of the code that need more testing.
It then engages in a conversation with an [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model),
prompting for tests, checking the results and re-prompting for adjustments as necessary.
Finally, CoverUp checks that the new tests work well together, attempting to resolve any issues it finds.

## Installing
CoverUp is available on PyPI, so you can install simply with
```shell
python3 -m pip install coverup
```

CoverUp currently requires an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) to run.
Your account will also need to have a [positive balance](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).
Create an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and store its "secret key" (usually a
string starting with `sk-`) in an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`:
```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<...your-api-key...>
```

## Using
If your module's source code is in `src` and your tests in `tests`, you can run CoverUp as
```shell
coverup --source-dir src --tests-dir tests
```
CoverUp then creates tests named `test_coverup_N.py`, where `N` is a number, under the `tests` directory.

### Example
Here we have CoverUp create additional tests for the popular package [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/):
```
$ coverup --source-dir src/flask --tests-dir tests
Measuring test suite coverage...  starting coverage: 90.2%
Prompting gpt-4-1106-preview for tests to increase coverage...
100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████| 95/95 [02:49<00:00,  1.79s/it, usage=~$3.30, G=51, F=141, U=22, R=0]
Checking test suite...  tests/test_coverup_2.py is failing, looking for culprit(s)...
Disabling tests/test_coverup_19.py
Checking test suite...  tests ok!
Measuring test suite coverage...  end coverage: 94.2%
```
In just short of 3 minutes, CoverUp increased Flask's test coverage from 90.2% to 94.2%.
It then detected that one of the new tests, `test_coverup_19`, was causing another test
to fail and disabled it.
That test remains as `disabled_test_coverup_19.py`, where it can be reviewed for the cause
and possibly re-added to the suite.

### Best Used With Docker
To evaluate the tests generated by the LLM, CoverUp must execute them.
To minimize security concerns, including the risk of damage to your system, we recommend
that you run CoverUp using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Work In Progress
Please enjoy this early release of CoverUp, and pardon any disruptions we may cause while we actively develop it.
